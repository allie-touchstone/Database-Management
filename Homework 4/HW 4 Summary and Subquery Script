This Homework was worked on by all 6 people and the best combination of code was ultimately decided on. 

*/

--- QUESTION 1
/* 

Write a SELECT statement that returns a single row with these columns:

The count of the records in the customer table with a column alias of count_of_customers
The minimum of the stay_credits_earned column in the customer table with column alias of min_credits
The maximum of the stay_credits_earned column in the customer table with column alias of max_credits 

*/

SELECT COUNT(customer_id) AS count_of_customers, MIN(stay_credits_earned) AS min_credits, MAX(stay_credits_earned) AS max_credits
FROM Customer;


--- QUESTION 2
/*

We want to know the number of reservations and earliest first check_in_date for each customer to understand which customers are our biggest fans and oldest patrons.

Task: Write a SELECT statement that returns one row for each customer that has a reservation with the following columns and please use table aliases as well:
The customer_id column from the customer table.   
The number of reservations on the reservation table with column alias of Number_of_Reservations
The earliest check_in_date for that customer. This helps us know how long they’ve been doing business with us.  Give this column the alias of earliest_check_in.

*/

SELECT C.customer_id, COUNT(R.reservation_id) AS Number_of_Reservations, MIN(R.check_in_date) AS earliest_check_in
FROM Customer C
    INNER JOIN Reservation R
        ON C.customer_id = R.customer_id
GROUP BY C.customer_id;


--- QUESTION 3
/* 

We’re curious how popular we are based on where customers are from.

Task: Write a SELECT statement that pulls info about customers and summarizes it by city and state.   The following columns should be returned:
The city column from the customer table
The state column from the customer table
The average stay_credits_earned for customers in that city, state.  Please round the results to the nearest whole number and give the column an alias of avg_credits_earned.
Sort the results by state ascending and then avg_credits_earned descending (i.e. largest first) 

*/ 

SELECT city, state, ROUND(AVG(stay_credits_earned)) AS avg_credits_earned
FROM Customer
GROUP BY city, state
ORDER BY state, avg_credits_earned DESC;


--- QUESTION 4
/* 

We’d like to know how many times each customer has stayed in a particular room at the South Austin location (i.e. Location_ID 1). Write a SELECT statement that properly joins customer, reservation, reservation_details, and room tables and then returns the following columns for only reservations at location 1:

The customer_id column
The last_name column
The room_number column
The count of reservations (i.e. reservation_id) for each room with a column alias of stay_count
Sort the result set by customer_id ascending and then by the stay_count alias in descending order.
This query should highlight for each customer if they’ve had more than 1 stay in a room or not. 
    
*/

SELECT C.customer_id, C.last_name, M.room_number, COUNT(R.reservation_id) AS stay_count
FROM Customer C
    INNER JOIN Reservation R
        ON C.customer_id = R.customer_id
    INNER JOIN Reservation_Details D
        ON R.reservation_id = D.reservation_id
    INNER JOIN Room M
        ON D.room_id = M.room_ID
WHERE R.location_id = 1
GROUP BY C.customer_id, C.last_name, M.room_number
ORDER BY C.customer_id, stay_count DESC;


--- QUESTION 5
/* 

Make a copy of the previous query and let’s make two updates to it. We decided we only want to look at completed reservations and not in-progress or future reservations so filter to only show status of C.  
Then filter out any results that have a stay_count of 2 or less.  This should result in showing us who has already stayed in a particular room 3 or more times.

*/

SELECT C.customer_id, C.last_name, M.room_number, COUNT(R.reservation_id) AS stay_count
FROM Customer C
    INNER JOIN Reservation R
        ON C.customer_id = R.customer_id
    INNER JOIN Reservation_Details D
        ON R.reservation_id = D.reservation_id
    INNER JOIN Room M
        ON D.room_id = M.room_ID
WHERE R.location_id = 1 
    AND R.status = 'C'
GROUP BY C.customer_id, C.last_name, M.room_number
    HAVING COUNT(R.reservation_id) > 2
ORDER BY C.customer_id, stay_count DESC;


--- QUESTION 6
/*

We want to know the anticipated number of guests by location and check_in_date.

Part A - Write a query that creates a report to show the sum of number_of_guests on Reservation broken out by the location_name and check_in_date for all reservations that have a future check_in_date (i.e. greater than today’s date).  The report should include the following

The location_name column from the location table
The check_in_date column from the reservation table
The sum of the number_of_guests column in the reservation table
Filter data to always show only records where the check_in_date is in the future.
Use the ROLLUP operator to include a row that gives the subtotal location_name, check_in_date. 

Part B – Explain in a commented sentence how the CUBE operator is different than ROLLUP and why it is useful.

*/

SELECT L.location_name, R.check_in_date, SUM(R.number_of_guests) AS number_of_guests
FROM Reservation R
    INNER JOIN Location L
        ON R.location_id = L.location_id
WHERE R.check_in_date > SYSDATE
GROUP BY ROLLUP(L.location_name, R.check_in_date);

/*

ROLLUP operators let you extend the functionality of GROUP BY clauses by calculating subtotals and grand totals for a set of columns. 
The CUBE operator is similar in functionality to the ROLLUP operator; however, the CUBE operator can calculate subtotals and grand totals for all permutations of the columns specified in it.
The CUBE operator is useful since it allows us to check subtotals beyond just the column hierarchy. For example, in Part A, we would be able to get a count of Customers across all Locations on a certain Date through CUBE.

*/


--- QUESTION 7
/* 

See if you can figure out which features exist at all 3 locations by joining tables, aggregating data, and using having clause. 
Write a query that query lists all the feature names and the count of locations that have that specific feature.  
Show the feature_name and the count of location_ids but use an alias to rename the count to count_of_locations. 
Lastly, filter out any rows in the query to show only rows that have a count greater than 2 because we only want to see the features that are at 3 locations (i.e. features that are at all locations)
    
*/

SELECT F.feature_name, COUNT(L.location_id) AS count_of_locations
FROM Location L
    INNER JOIN Location_Features_Linking J
        ON L.location_id = J.location_id
    INNER JOIN Features F
        ON J.feature_id = F.feature_id
GROUP BY F.feature_name
    HAVING COUNT(L.location_id) > 2;


--- QUESTION 8
/* 

Write a query that returns the same result set as this select statement, but don’t use a left join this time. 
Instead, use a subquery in a WHERE clause that uses the NOT IN keyword. 
Hint: Start by getting a list of all the customer_ids in the reservation table. 
This will be used as the subquery in a query that pulls all customers where the customer_id is not in that list.

select distinct c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, c.email
from customer c left join reservation r on c.customer_id = r.customer_id
where reservation_id is null;

*/

SELECT DISTINCT customer_id, first_name, last_name, email
FROM Customer
WHERE customer_id NOT IN (
    SELECT customer_id
    FROM Reservation);


--- QUESTION 9
/* 

We want to know all the customers that have earned more than the average number of stay credits.

Write a query statement that answers this question: Which customers have a stay_credits_earned balance that’s greater than the average stay_credits_earned all customers?
Return the first_name, last_name, email, phone, and stay_credits_earned for each customer.
Sort the results by the stay_credits_earned from highest to lowest

*/

SELECT first_name, last_name, email, phone, stay_credits_earned
FROM Customer
WHERE stay_credits_earned > (
    SELECT AVG(stay_credits_earned)
    FROM Customer)
ORDER BY stay_credits_earned DESC;


--- QUESTION 10
/* 

Write a query that returns four columns: city, state, the sum of stay_credits_earned (with an alias of total_earned), and the sum of stay_credits_used (with an alias of total_used statement). 
To do this, you need to use GROUP BY. Sort the results by state, city.  
This should return a list of the cities by state and the total credits earned and used among all customers from that city.  

Then, write a second query that uses the first select statement in its FROM clause just to prove you know how to select from a query (i.e. an in-line join). 
The main query should return the following columns city, state, credits_remaining.  
To return credits_remaining, use an expression that subtracts total_used from total_earned.     

Order final results by order by credits_remaining desc.

*/

--- 1st QUERY

SELECT city, state, SUM(stay_credits_earned) AS total_earned, SUM(stay_credits_used) AS total_used
FROM Customer
GROUP BY city, state
ORDER BY state, city;

--- 2nd QUERY

SELECT city, state, total_earned - total_used AS credits_remaining
FROM (
    SELECT city, state, SUM(stay_credits_earned) AS total_earned, SUM(stay_credits_used) AS total_used
    FROM Customer
    GROUP BY city, state
    ORDER BY state, city)
ORDER BY credits_remaining DESC;


--- QUESTION 11
/* 

Goal: We want to know who is going to be staying in a room that hasn’t been used much. We define a room that hasn’t been used much, as a room that has been reserved less than 5 times

Write a query that returns the confirmation_nbr, date_created, check_in_date, status, and room_id of each reservation that exists for a room that has less than 5 reservation_detail records. 
We want you to utilize a subquery to do this.  
Hint: Start by selecting all room_id and count of room_ids from reservation_details and grouping by room_id and filter down to only the room_ids that have a reservation_detail count less than 5. 
Once you have this query running you can remove the count(room_id) from the select so you only have a list of room_ids. 
Once you have your list of room_ids that are not used much, use this as a subquery in the WHERE portion of another query that pulls the columns from reservation and reservation_details. 
Include a final filter on the outer query to ignore reservations that are completed (i.e. status of C)  

*/

SELECT R.confirmation_nbr, R.date_created, R.check_in_date, R.status, D.room_id
FROM Reservation R
    INNER JOIN Reservation_Details D
        ON R.reservation_id = D.reservation_id
WHERE D.room_id IN (
        SELECT room_id
        FROM Reservation_Details
        GROUP BY room_id
        HAVING COUNT(room_id) < 5)
    AND R.status <> 'C';


--- QUESTION 12
/* 

Goal: We want to know which customers that are using Mastercard (i.e. MSTR) have only made a single reservation because Mastercard users will get a special $10 credit on their cards on their first stay at our hotel.

Using an inline view, write a statement that will return one row per customer that has only 1 completed reservation and is using Mastercard. 
Each row should include the following columns we need to process the credit:  cardholder_first_name, cardholder_last_name, card_number, expiration_date, and cc_id
Using an inline view means you will have a subquery in the main query’s FROM clause that acts as its own table that you will join customer_payment to.
HINT: Start by coding the subquery that pulls customer_id and the count of reservation_ids but only for reservations that have a status of C and only where the count of reservations is 1. 
Then join this subquery as an inline view to the customer_payment table to complete the query.  
After you have the subquery complete you can then incorporate it with the final outer query as an inline table join and then add a filter to the outer query that only shows cardholders using Mastercard (i.e. card_type of MSTR)

*/

SELECT P.cardholder_first_name, P.cardholder_last_name, P.card_number, P.expiration_date, P.cc_id
FROM Customer_Payment P
    INNER JOIN (
        SELECT customer_id, COUNT(reservation_id) AS count_of_reservations
        FROM Reservation
        WHERE status = 'C'
        GROUP BY customer_id
        HAVING COUNT(reservation_id) = 1) R
