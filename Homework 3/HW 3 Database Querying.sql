This Homework was worked on by all 6 people and the best combination of code was ultimately decided on. 

*/

---Question 1
/* Write a SELECT statement that returns the following columns from the 
Customer_Payment table: Cardholder first name, cardholder last name, the card 
type, and the card expiration date. Then, run this statement to make sure it 
works correctly. Add an ORDER BY clause to this statement that sorts the result 
set by expiration date in ascending order (i.e. oldest to newest). Then, run this 
statement again to make sure it works correctly. Note, this is a good way to 
iteratively build and test a statement, one clause at a time. */

SELECT cardholder_first_name, cardholder_last_name, card_type, expiration_date
FROM Customer_Payment
ORDER BY expiration_date ASC;


---Question 2
/*Write a SELECT statement that returns one column from the Customer table named 
customer_full_name that combines the first_name and last_name columns. Format 
this column with the first name, a space, and last name like this: Michael 
Jordan. Sort the result set by last name in descending sequence. Use the â€œINâ€? 
operator to return only the customers whose first name begins with letters 
of A, B, or C.*/

SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name as customer_full_name
FROM customer
    WHERE SUBSTR(first_name, 1, 1) IN ('A', 'B', 'C')
ORDER BY last_name DESC;


---Question 3
/* Write a SELECT statement that returns these columns from Reservation: 
customer_id, confirmation_nbr, date_created, check_in_date, and number_of_guests. 
Return only the rows for reservations that have a status of â€œupcomingâ€? that have 
check_in_dates that are today or in the future but only for this year. That means 
to filter where only the check_in_date is greater or equal the current date 
(note: use SYSDATE here) and on or before Dec 31st  See if you can do this with 
only the following operators (<, >, <=, or >=). */ 

SELECT customer_id, confirmation_nbr, date_created, check_in_date, number_of_guests
FROM Reservation
WHERE status = 'U'
    AND (check_in_date >= SYSDATE AND check_in_date <= '31-DEC-21');


---Question 4
/* This is a two-part question:
    Part A: Create a duplicate of the previous query but this time update the 
    WHERE clause to use the BETWEEN operator. Keep the rest of the query the same. */
SELECT customer_id, confirmation_nbr, date_created, check_in_date, number_of_guests
FROM Reservation
WHERE status = 'U'
    AND (check_in_date BETWEEN SYSDATE AND '31-DEC-21');


/*  Part B: Using the MINUS operator, compare the query from #3 to the query from 
    Part A in #4.  If you get no rows returned, that means the queries produce 
    the same results. Pretty cool huh!?! */
    
SELECT customer_id, confirmation_nbr, date_created, check_in_date, number_of_guests
FROM Reservation
WHERE status = 'U'
    AND (check_in_date >= SYSDATE AND check_in_date <= '31-DEC-21') 
MINUS
SELECT customer_id, confirmation_nbr, date_created, check_in_date, number_of_guests
FROM Reservation
WHERE status = 'U' 
    AND (check_in_date BETWEEN SYSDATE AND '31-DEC-21');


---Question 5
/* Write a SELECT statement that returns these column names and data from the 
Reservation table:
    customer_id     The customer_id column
    location_id     The location_id column
    length_of_stay  This is calculated by subtracting check_in_date from 
        the check_out_date. Assign an alias of length_of_stay 
Filter the query to only show completed reservations (i.e. status = â€˜Câ€™).  
After you have that running correctly, update filter to use the ROWNUM pseudo 
column so the result set contains only the first 10 rows from the table.

Sort the result set by the column alias length_of_stay in descending order and 
then also by customer_id ascending */

SELECT customer_id, location_id, (check_out_date - check_in_date) AS length_of_stay
FROM Reservation
WHERE status = 'C' AND
    ROWNUM <= 10
ORDER BY length_of_stay DESC, customer_id;


---Question 6
/*Write a SELECT statement that returns the first_name, last_name, email from 
Customer and also a fourth column called credits_available. The credits available 
is calculated by subtracting credits used from credits earned.  Once you have 
this, filter to only show customers with at least 10 or more credits available.  
Sort results by the column alias credits_available.*/

SELECT first_name, last_name, email, (stay_credits_earned - stay_credits_used) as credits_available
FROM Customer
WHERE (stay_credits_earned - stay_credits_used) >= 10
ORDER BY credits_available;


---Question 7
/* Write a SELECT statement that returns the first, middle, and last name of a 
customerâ€™s payment profile on Customer_Payment
    Using the NULL operator, return only rows for those customers with a middle 
    name. Sort by column positions 2 and then 3 in ascending order */

SELECT cardholder_first_name, cardholder_mid_name, cardholder_last_name
FROM customer_payment
WHERE cardholder_mid_name IS NOT Null
ORDER BY 2, 3;


---Question 8
/* Using the DUAL table write a SELECT statement that uses SYSDATE function to 
create a row with these columns:

today_unformatted         The SYSDATE function unformatted
today_formatted           The SYSDATE function in this format: MM/DD/YYYY

This displays a number for the month, a number for the day, and a four-digit year. 
Use a FROM clause that specifies the Dual table. Hint: You will need to implement 
the TO_CHAR function to format the sysdate in the format designated above.

After you write this add the following columns to the row:

Credits_Earned        25
Stays_Earned          25 / 10
Redeemable_stays      (25/10) returned with FLOOR() function
Next_Stay_to_earn     (25/10) rounded to nearest whole number   

Your result table contains only one row. */

SELECT SYSDATE as today_unformatted,
        TO_CHAR(SYSDATE, 'MM/DD/YYYY') as today_formatted,
        25 as credits_earned,
        25 / 10 as stays_earned,
        FLOOR(25/10) as redeemable_stays,
        ROUND(25/10) next_stay_to_earn
FROM Dual;


---Question 9
/* Write a SELECT statement that pulls Reservation records for all reservations 
that are completed (i.e. status of C) for location 2. Return only the following 
columns: Customer_id, Location_id, and a calculated column called length_of_stay 
which is just checkout date minus check-in date. Sort the results by 
length_of_stay descending and customer_id ascending. Lastly only pull in the top 
20 rows. That means we want you to sort the table before filtering the 20 rows.  
Hint: Do this using FETCH command and not with a subquery since subqueries come later. */

SELECT Customer_id, Location_id, (check_out_date - check_in_date) as length_of_stay
FROM Reservation
WHERE location_id = 2 AND status = 'C'
ORDER BY length_of_stay DESC, customer_id
FETCH FIRST 20 ROWS ONLY;


---Question 10
/* Pull all customers and their reservations. Filter data to only show completed
reservations (i.e. status is C).  Return just the following columns: first_name, 
last_name, confirmation_nbr, date_created, check_in_date, check_out_date. Sort 
results by customer_id ascending and check_out_date descending so that we see 
all customers and their most recent checkouts first. */

SELECT C.first_name, C.last_name, R.confirmation_nbr, R.date_created, R.check_in_date, R.check_out_date
FROM Customer C
    INNER JOIN Reservation R
        ON C.customer_id = R.customer_id
WHERE R.status = 'C'
ORDER BY C.customer_id, R.check_out_date DESC;


---Question 11
/* Write a query that joins matching records between the following tables 
(Customer, Reservation, Reservation_Details, and Room) so we can understand what
rooms customers are staying in. Only return rows for upcoming reservations 
(i.e. status of U) and for customers that have earned more than 40 credits.  
The query should display the following columns:

Name â€“ a concatenation of a customerâ€™s first and last name like so: e.g. Tayfun Keskin
Location_ID
Confirmation_Nbr
Check_in_date
Room_number */

SELECT C.first_name || ' ' || C.last_name as Name, R.location_id, R.confirmation_nbr, R.check_in_date, M.room_number
FROM Customer C
    INNER JOIN Reservation R
        ON C.customer_id = R.customer_id
    INNER JOIN Reservation_Details D
        ON R.reservation_id = D.reservation_id
    INNER JOIN Room M
        ON D.room_id = M.room_ID
WHERE R.status = 'U' and C.stay_credits_earned > 40;


---Question 12
/* Write a query that returns any customers in our systemâ€™s customer table that 
have never had a reservation. Show that you can use the proper type of join that
will return all customers even when thereâ€™s no matching reservation for them. 
Results should display the following columns for the customer: first_name, 
last_name, confirmation_nbr, date_created, check_in_date, check_out_date */

SELECT C.first_name, C.last_name, R.confirmation_nbr, R.date_created, R.check_in_date, R.check_out_date
FROM Customer C
    LEFT JOIN Reservation R
        ON C.customer_id = R.customer_id
WHERE R.customer_id is NULL;


---Question 13
/* Use the UNION operator to generate a result set consisting of five columns 
(four directly from the Customer table, and one calculated) as below:

Status_level       A calculated column that contains a value of â€˜1-Gold Memberâ€™, â€˜2-Platinum Memberâ€™, or â€˜3-Diamond Clubâ€™
First_name
Last_name
Email
Stay_Credits_earned

If the customer has less than 10 credits (i.e. they havenâ€™t earned a free stay 
yet),they are considered to be Gold Level and so their status_level column 
should contain a literal string value of â€˜1-Gold Memberâ€™. If the customer has 
earned more than or equal to 10 credits but less than 40, their status_level 
column should contain a literal string value of â€˜2-Platinum Memberâ€™. Otherwise, 
it the status_level is â€˜3-Diamond Clubâ€™

Sort the final result set by the first and third columns in the results. */

SELECT '1-Gold Member' AS status_level, first_name, last_name, email, stay_credits_earned
    FROM customer
    WHERE stay_credits_earned < 10
UNION
SELECT '2-Platinum Member' AS status_level, first_name, last_name, email, stay_credits_earned
    FROM customer
    WHERE (stay_credits_earned >= 10) AND (stay_credits_earned < 40)
UNION
SELECT '3-Diamond Club' AS status_level, first_name, last_name, email, stay_credits_earned
    FROM customer
    WHERE stay_credits_earned >= 40
ORDER BY 1, 3;
